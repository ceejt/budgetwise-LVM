# Phase 7: Bill Reminders - Complete Implementation

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Overview

Phase 7 implements a comprehensive bill tracking and reminder system that helps users manage upcoming payments, avoid late fees, and track payment history. The system includes smart transaction matching, calendar/list views, and intelligent reminders.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`scripts/008_add_bill_reminders.sql`)

✅ **Bills Table** with comprehensive fields:
- Basic information: name, amount, due_date, category_id, status
- Recurrence settings: is_recurring, recurrence_pattern, recurrence_end_date
- Reminder settings: reminder_days_before, reminder_enabled
- Auto-payment: auto_pay_enabled, wallet_id
- Tracking: linked_transaction_id, last_paid_date, payment_count
- Metadata: notes, merchant_name

✅ **Database Views:**
- `upcoming_bills_view` - Bills with calculated days until due, reminder status
- `bill_analytics_view` - User-level analytics (monthly totals, payment rates)

✅ **Database Functions:**
- `update_overdue_bills()` - Auto-update bills past due date
- `mark_bill_as_paid(bill_id, transaction_id)` - Mark paid and create next occurrence
- `calculate_bill_match_score(bill_id, transaction_id)` - Smart matching algorithm (0-100)

✅ **Indexes and Triggers:**
- Performance indexes on user_id, due_date, status
- Auto-update `updated_at` timestamp trigger
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all operations

### 2. TypeScript Types (`lib/types.ts`)

✅ **Core Types:**
```typescript
BillStatus = "unpaid" | "paid" | "overdue" | "scheduled"
Bill - Complete bill interface with all fields
UpcomingBill - Extended with days_until_due, reminder flags
BillAnalytics - User analytics summary
BillMatchResult - Transaction matching results with confidence score
```

### 3. Bill Operations Utility (`lib/utils/bill-operations.ts`)

✅ **15+ Utility Functions:**
- `fetchBills()` - Get all user bills
- `fetchUpcomingBills()` - Get bills from upcoming_bills_view

### Smart Matching Algorithm
The `calculate_bill_match_score` function uses a weighted scoring system (0-100):

**Amount Matching (40 points):**
- Exact match: 40 points
- Within ₱10: 30 points
- Within ₱50: 20 points
- Within ₱100: 10 points

**Category Matching (25 points):**
- Same category: 25 points

**Date Proximity (25 points):**
- Same day: 25 points
- Within 3 days: 20 points
- Within 7 days: 15 points
- Within 14 days: 10 points

**Merchant/Description Matching (10 points):**
- Description contains merchant name: 10 points
- Merchant contains description: 5 points

**Match Levels:**
- **High (≥70):** Auto-match recommended
- **Medium (50-69):** Manual review suggested
- **Low (<50):** Poor match

### Reminders & Alerts
- ✅ Configurable reminder window (days before due)
- ✅ Dashboard alerts for upcoming bills
- ✅ Overdue bill warnings
- ✅ Dismissible notifications
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

CREATE TABLE bills (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (amount > 0),
    due_date DATE NOT NULL,
    category_id UUID,
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('unpaid', 'paid', 'overdue', 'scheduled')),

    -- Recurrence
    is_recurring BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    recurrence_pattern TEXT,
    recurrence_end_date DATE,

    -- Reminders
    reminder_days_before INTEGER DEFAULT 3 CHECK (0-30),

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Bill

```typescript
import { createBill } from "@/lib/utils/bill-operations"

// One-time bill
await createBill({
  name: "Electric Bill",
  amount: 1500,
  due_date: "2025-11-15",
  category_id: "category-uuid",
  status: "unpaid",
  is_recurring: false,
  reminder_enabled: true,
  reminder_days_before: 3,
  auto_pay_enabled: false,
  merchant_name: "Meralco",
  notes: "November billing",
})

// Recurring bill
await createBill({
  name: "Rent",
  amount: 15000,
  due_date: "2025-11-01",
  category_id: null,
  status: "unpaid",
  is_recurring: true,
  recurrence_pattern: "monthly",
  recurrence_end_date: null, // Indefinite
  reminder_enabled: true,
  reminder_days_before: 5,
  auto_pay_enabled: false,
  notes: "Monthly rent payment",
})
```

### Marking Bill as Paid

```typescript
import { markBillAsPaid } from "@/lib/utils/bill-operations"

// Without linking to transaction
await markBillAsPaid("bill-uuid")

// With transaction link
await markBillAsPaid("bill-uuid", "transaction-uuid")
```

### Smart Matching

```typescript
import { findMatchingBills, calculateBillMatchScore } from "@/lib/utils/bill-operations"

// Find matches for a transaction
const matches = await findMatchingBills(transaction)
// Returns: [{ bill_id, transaction_id, confidence_score, match_level }]

// Calculate specific match score
const score = await calculateBillMatchScore("bill-uuid", "transaction-uuid")
// Returns: 0-100
```

### Fetching Bills

```typescript
import {
  fetchUpcomingBills,
  fetchBillsNeedingReminders,
  fetchOverdueBills,
  getBillsDueInDays,
} from "@/lib/utils/bill-operations"

// All upcoming unpaid bills
const upcoming = await fetchUpcomingBills()

// Bills needing reminders
const reminders = await fetchBillsNeedingReminders()

// Overdue bills
const overdue = await fetchOverdueBills()

// Bills due in next 7 days
const weekBills = await getBillsDueInDays(7)
```

## Component Usage

### In Your Dashboard

```tsx
import { BillsSection } from "@/components/dashboard/bills-section"
import { BillAlerts } from "@/components/dashboard/bill-alerts"

  return (
    <>
      {/* Show alerts at top */}
      <BillAlerts />

      {/* Bills section */}
      <BillsSection categories={categories} wallets={wallets} />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Auto-Pay Not Implemented** - Auto-pay toggle is disabled ("Coming Soon")
2. **No Edit Dialog** - Must delete and recreate to change bill details
3. **No Bill History View** - Can't see past paid bills easily
4. **No Bulk Operations** - Can't select multiple bills at once
5. **Smart Matching is Manual** - Auto-matching exists but no UI trigger
6. **No Email Notifications** - Reminders only show in dashboard

---

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ **Indexed Queries** - All common queries use indexes
- ✅ **View-Based Analytics** - Pre-calculated in database views
- ✅ **Efficient Matching** - Smart matching uses database functions
- ✅ **Pagination Ready** - Can add pagination to list view if needed
- ✅ **Local Dismissal** - Alert dismissal uses localStorage (no DB writes)

---

## Security

- ✅ **RLS Enabled** - Users can only see their own bills
- ✅ **Server-Side Validation** - Amount checks, date validations
- ✅ **SQL Injection Protected** - Using Supabase client (parameterized queries)
- ✅ **Auth Required** - All operations require authenticated user

---
