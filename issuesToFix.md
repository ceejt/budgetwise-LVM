‚óè Based on my research and code analysis, I can see BudgetWise has several features that are either hardcoded or
non-functional. Let me create a comprehensive implementation plan:

üîç Current Issues Found:

1. Goals Section - Completely static and hardcoded:

- Only supports "Weekly Savings" and "Scholarship" goals (lines 108-200 in goals-section.tsx)
- Weekly calendar visualization is fake (just shows days highlighted up to today)
- No actual progress tracking (current_amount field exists in database but never updated)
- Categories budget display has no spending comparison

2. Summary Section - Most features are non-functional:

- Period selector (daily/weekly/monthly) doesn't filter data - just shows all-time totals
- Scholarship card is hardcoded mockup with fake "DOST-SEI", "LANDBANK", etc.
- E-wallet "Cash In/Out" buttons don't work
- E-wallet balance is disconnected from transactions

3. Expenses/Income - Missing critical features:

- Sorting dropdown is static decoration
- No filtering by date range, category, or amount
- No recurring transaction detection
- No budget alerts or warnings

4. Missing Core Features:

- No spending analytics or insights
- No budget vs actual tracking
- No recurring expenses/income
- No bill reminders
- No export functionality
- No bulk operations

üìã Implementation Plan

‚óè Detailed Implementation Plan

---

PHASE 1: Fix Goals System (Priority: HIGH)

What's broken: Goals are hardcoded to only "Weekly Savings" and "Scholarship", no real progress tracking

What real apps do:

- Custom goal creation (any name, any amount, any timeframe)
- Visual progress bars showing % completion
- Automatic allocation from income
- Milestone celebrations
- Multiple concurrent goals

Implementation:

1. Replace hardcoded goals UI with dynamic goal list from database
2. Add proper goal creation dialog:


    - Name, target amount, deadline
    - Optional: category (vacation, emergency fund, gadget, etc.)
    - Optional: auto-contribution amount/frequency

3. Implement progress tracking:


    - Add "Contribute to Goal" feature in income/transaction flows
    - Update current_amount when users allocate funds
    - Calculate and display progress percentage
    - Show projected completion date based on current rate

4. Add goal management:


    - Edit goal details
    - Pause/resume goals
    - Mark as completed when reached
    - Archive completed/failed goals

5. Visual improvements:


    - Replace fake calendar with actual progress bars
    - Add charts showing goal progress over time
    - Color-code goals (green=on track, yellow=slow, red=behind)

Files to modify:

- components/dashboard/goals-section.tsx (complete rewrite)
- Create new components/dashboard/add-goal-dialog.tsx (already exists but check implementation)
- Create components/dashboard/contribute-to-goal-dialog.tsx (new)
- Update lib/types.ts (add category, auto_contribution fields to Goal)

---

PHASE 2: Fix Summary Analytics (Priority: HIGH)

What's broken: Period selector doesn't filter, scholarship card is fake, no insights

What real apps do:

- Filter expenses by daily/weekly/monthly/yearly periods
- Show spending trends (up/down vs last period)
- Category breakdown with percentages
- "In My Pocket" feature showing available spending
- Spending predictions

Implementation:

1. Make period filter functional:


    - Daily: Today's transactions only
    - Weekly: Last 7 days
    - Monthly: Current month
    - Add comparison with previous period ("‚Üë15% vs last week")

2. Remove hardcoded scholarship card or make it dynamic:


    - Only show if user has scholarship-type income
    - Pull real data from income transactions

3. Add spending insights:


    - Top spending categories this period
    - Average daily spending
    - Largest single expense
    - Most frequent merchant/category

4. Add "Available to Spend" calculation:


    - Formula: (Income - Expenses - Goal Allocations - Upcoming Bills) / Days Remaining
    - Display prominently: "You can spend ‚Ç±X per day"

5. Add trend charts:


    - Line chart showing daily spending over time
    - Bar chart comparing categories period-over-period

Files to modify:

- components/dashboard/summary-section.tsx (major refactor)
- Create lib/utils/analytics.ts (new - calculation functions)
- Create components/dashboard/spending-insights-card.tsx (new)
- Create components/dashboard/available-to-spend-card.tsx (new)

    - When transaction is edited/deleted ‚Üí adjust balance

3. Implement Cash In/Out:


    - Cash In: Create income transaction, increase balance
