- ❌ No spending insights or analytics
- ❌ No trend comparisons
- ❌ No "Available to Spend" feature
- ❌ No charts or visualizations

#### After (Fixed):
- ✅ **Functional Period Filter**: Daily/Weekly/Monthly actually filters transactions
- ✅ **Real-time Period Label**: Shows "Today", "Last 7 Days", "This Month"
- ✅ **Trend Comparisons**: Shows % change vs previous period (↑15% vs last week)
- ✅ **Dynamic Scholarship Card**: Only shows if user has scholarship-type income
  - Pulls real scholarship income data
  - Shows actual goal progress
  - Displays recent scholarship payments
- ✅ **Integrated Analytics Cards**:
  - Available to Spend Card (top priority placement)
  - Spending Insights Card
  - Spending Trend Chart (line graph)
  - Category Comparison Chart (bar graph)
- ✅ **Smart Data Fetching**: Fetches both income and expenses
- ✅ **Period-based Calculations**: All metrics recalculate when period changes

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Functional Period Filtering ✅
```typescript
const currentPeriodRange = getPeriodRange(period)
const currentPeriodTransactions = filterTransactionsByPeriod(
  allTransactions,
  currentPeriodRange.startDate,
  currentPeriodRange.endDate
)
```
- **Daily**: Today's transactions only
- **Weekly**: Last 7 days
- **Monthly**: Current month
- All analytics update in real-time when period changes

### 2. Spending Trends (vs Previous Period) ✅
```typescript
const trendComparison = calculateTrendComparison(currentExpenses, previousExpenses)
// Result: { percentageChange: 15.2, trend: "up" }
```
- Visual indicators: ↑ (up), ↓ (down), – (stable)
- Color-coded: Red (increase), Green (decrease), Gray (stable)
- Percentage change displayed: "↑15% vs previous week"

### 3. Dynamic Scholarship Card ✅
```typescript
const hasScholarship = currentIncome.some(
  t => t.category_name?.toLowerCase().includes("scholarship") ||

)
```
- Only shows if user has scholarship income
- Displays real scholarship amount and date
- Shows related goal progress if exists
- No more fake DOST-SEI/LANDBANK data!

### 4. Available to Spend Calculation ✅
```typescript
const availableToSpend = calculateAvailableToSpend(
  currentIncome,

  goals,
  period
)
// Formula: (Income - Expenses - Goal Allocations) / Days Remaining
```
- Shows total available amount
- Calculates daily spending allowance
